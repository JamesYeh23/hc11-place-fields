## 2026-09-16 — Step 1: repository and environment setup

**Done**

- Created the repository at `Place Field/hc11-place-fields/`, a sibling of the existing
  `hc-11_Data/` and `Article/` folders, so that no data or paper PDF is ever inside the
  git tree (decision D1.1).
- Package layout: `src/hc11/`, `config/`, `scripts/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`, `docs/`,
  `results/`.
- `pyproject.toml` (hatchling build, `src/` layout) with runtime deps numpy, scipy,
  pandas, h5py, matplotlib, pyyaml, tqdm and a `dev` extra (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff,
  jupyterlab, ipykernel). `uv.lock` committed, 113 packages resolved.
- `.gitignore` excludes `data/`, `*.mat`, `*.pdf`, `results/**`, and the usual Python and
  macOS noise.
- `config/params.yaml`: every analysis parameter for steps 3–5 in one file, each tagged
  `[CHEN2016]`, `[GB2016]`, `[DATA]` or `[PROVISIONAL]`.
- `src/hc11/config.py`: repo-root detection, data-directory resolution
  (`$HC11_DATA_DIR` → `<repo>/data/raw/NoveltySessInfoMatFiles` →
  `<repo>/../hc-11_Data/NoveltySessInfoMatFiles`), session inventory, YAML parameter
  loading with a dotted-key accessor that raises on unknown keys, and `git_commit()` with
  a `-dirty` suffix for figure provenance.
- `docs/decisions.md` seeded with the step-1 decisions and the rationale for every
  provisional parameter already in the config.
- `docs/data_schema.md` stubbed, to be filled from the actual HDF5 tree in step 2.
- Tests: 23 passing (`tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_data_present.py`). Ruff clean.

**Results**

- All 8 session files are present and resolve correctly:
  Achilles ×2, Buddy ×1, Cicero ×3, Gatsby ×2; 287 MB total.
- Confirmed from the file headers that every session file is a genuine MATLAB v7.3 file:
  128-byte description reads `MATLAB 7.3 MAT-file, Platform: PCWIN64, Created on:
  Fri Nov 25 17:35:00 2016 HDF5 schema 1.00`, with the HDF5 superblock signature at byte
  offset 512 (after the userblock). So `h5py` is the right reader and `scipy.io.loadmat`
  would indeed fail, as expected.

**Open questions**

- `dataset.position_rate_hz` (39.06) and the unit-type label spellings (`pyr` / `int`) are
  placeholders taken from the data description; step 2 must confirm all of them from the
  file and the loader must warn rather than trust them.
- `place_fields.smoothing_sigma_bins`: Chen et al.'s "smoothing over ~5 bins" is
  ambiguous. Currently read as σ ≈ 1 bin (≈5 bins of kernel support). Worth a sensitivity
  check once real maps exist — the alternative reading, σ = 5 bins = 50 cm, would be very
  heavy for a linear track.
- The `results/` sidecar-JSON writer is specified in the config but not yet implemented;
  it lands with the first figure-producing step.

**Time**: ~45 min.
